# BeautySalon-SoftWare
The software of the beauty salon, which is written in C (not using OOP). Documentation on Russian.
I made this project for my exam. I didn't know OOP than, so I made it like a console application.
Here you(seller or manager) could choose language before you start. Seller can enter information about services client chosen and 
after that print a bill.
Manager can change prices and add or delete some services.
All information keeps in binary files.
